# VCompression

Developed mainly for company use, specifically at my current job. This will automate the task of compressing downloaded images and converting them into WebP format. Combining this with VScraper will save hours of work time and can achieve hours worth of results done with manual work, in seconds using the 2 automated scripts VScraper and VCompression.
